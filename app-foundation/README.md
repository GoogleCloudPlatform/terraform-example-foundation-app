# terraform-example-foundation-app/app-foundation

## Overview
The `app-foundation` folder contains additional Terraform configurations required for Bank Of Anthos deployment and are meant to fit into the framework defined by [terraform-example-foundation](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation). Each folder contains its own directory that must be applied separately, and in sequence, to correctly deploy the application. The necessary steps are outlined below for the relevant folders.

### [3. networks](./3-networks/)

This step focuses on creating a Shared VPC per environment (`development`, `non-production` & `production`) that is consistent with the Bank of Anthos application's configuration and has a reasonable security baseline. **This is not a complete configuration - this configuration is expected to be used in conjunction with [terraform-example-foundation/3-networks](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation/tree/master/3-networks) in hub and spoke mode**. Currently, this supplemental configuration includes:

- Example subnets for `development`, `non-production` & `production` inclusive of secondary ranges for the Bank of Anthos application.
- Additional firewall rules that are necessary for the configuration to work. **Please note that there are temporary firewall rules within this configuration that should be removed once the entire Bank of Anthos deployment is complete.**

Usage instructions are available for the networks step in the [README](./3-networks/README.md).

### [4. projects](./4-projects/)

This step focuses on creating service projects, including an application CI/CD pipeline project and an infrastructure pipeline project that are necessary for the Bank of Anthos configuration to work. Currently, this includes:

- 5 service projects with a standard configuration that are attached to the shared VPC in the previous step
- An application CI/CD pipeline project that will help with deployment of the example application
- An infrastructure pipeline project that will also help with deployment of the example application

Deploying this code as-is will generate the additional folder structure shown below:
