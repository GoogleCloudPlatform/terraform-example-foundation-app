## Instructions

1. Enable optional firewall rules in your shared VPC by modifying your 3-networks/envs/dev/main.tf and adding the following `optional_fw_rules_enabled = true`
1. Ensure that you have enabled the following APIs enabled in your project, by adding `activate_apis = ["container.googleapis.com", "iap.googleapis.com"]`
1. Ensure that the user running the terraform has necessary permissions (TODO: add required permissions here).
1. Set necessary variables as env vars or tfvars file. These will be outputs (TODO:example-foundation) after spinning up a project.
1. tf init, plan and apply
1. Run the command `gcloud compute ssh ... ` given by the output `bastion_ssh` in terminal window. This will open an ssh tunnel.
1. In a seperate terminal window run `gcloud container clusters ... ` given by the output `connect_svpc_cluster_internal`. This will generate the kubeconfig.
1. Run command `HTTPS_PROXY=localhost:8888 kubectl get pods --all-namespaces` given by the output `example_kubectl_command` to verify the setup. This should list all pods across all ns.
1. Run `./deploy.sh` to deploy HipsterShop.
1. Run `HTTPS_PROXY=localhost:8888 kubectl get svc frontend-external` and wait till an external ip address has been assigned.
